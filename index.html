            <h3>Background and career</h3>
            <p>
              Teeks is a soul singer from New Zealand. His music is a blend of
              soul, R&B, and pop, with influences from his Māori heritage.
              Teeks' real name is Te Karehana Gardiner-Toi. He was born in
              Rotorua, New Zealand, and is of Ngāpuhi and Ngāi Tūhoe descent.
              Teeks began his music career in 2013 when he released his debut
              single "Without You". He has since released several singles and an
              EP titled "Something to Feel". His music has been praised for its
              emotional depth and powerful vocals.

              Having grown up entrenched in waiata and kapa haka, the Maori
              words for song and dance, Teeks says his culture continues to
              shape his sound and provides a through line to his work. (He also
              grew up listening to artists such as Bob Marley and Elvis
              Presley.) “Performing and singing is such a big part of our
              culture,” he says. “The way we pass on our history is through song
              and chants, so ever since I was young, I've always been singing.
              All my friends and everyone around me could sing, so I thought
              that's just how everyone in the world was.”

              Hi! My name is Karabo and I've been listening to Teeks for a few
              years now. I love his voice and his music always makes me feel
              better. I created this page to share my love for Teeks and his
              music with you.
